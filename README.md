# Project 4: Markdown Blog

Tutorial followed along from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrHkjlWVhM&t=87s


A simple markdown blog app with full CRUD abilities. 

npm run devStart will run this blog on localhost:5000



Note: Code is solid and was working just fine, but I've run into issues with Mongodb and have since been unable to get localhost to connect.
